# JPV-OS Access Gateway

JPV-OS Access Gateway is the application-facing gateway for the JPV ecosystem.

It provides the structured interface for access routing, dashboard entry, role-aware experience design, and future entitlement alignment across the JayPVentures LLC infrastructure and creator-facing systems.

## Operational Purpose

## Repository Status

This repository replaces the temporary Visual Studio project name WebApplication1.

## Governance Alignment

This repo must preserve:

- security policy enforcement
- role-based access architecture
- audit-friendly deployment history
- human-review protections
- interoperability freedom
- vendor-boundary separation
- JPV-OS people-protection standards

## Primary Stack

- .NET / Blazor
