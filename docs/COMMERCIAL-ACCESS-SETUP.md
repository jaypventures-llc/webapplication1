- STRIPE_PRICE_MEMBER_MONTHLY
- STRIPE_PRICE_MEMBER_ANNUAL
- STRIPE_PRICE_CREATOR_MONTHLY

## 4. Discord Roles to Create

Create the following roles in your Discord server and copy their IDs:

- Member
- Creator
- Partner
- Enterprise
- Custom

Assign the role IDs to the corresponding environment variables above.

## 5. Local Test Checklist

- [ ] Set all required environment variables in your .env or launch profile.
- [ ] Run `dotnet build` and `dotnet run`.
- [ ] Test Stripe checkout flow (use test keys).
- [ ] Test Stripe webhook (use Stripe CLI to forward events).
- [ ] Test Discord OAuth connection and role assignment.
- [ ] Confirm entitlement state updates on payment, cancellation, and failure.
- [ ] Confirm no secrets are present in appsettings files or source code.

## 6. Persistence Requirement

- **In-memory entitlement storage is NOT production-ready.**
- For production, you must use a persistent repository (e.g., SQLite, SQL Server, or cloud DB) for entitlements.
- The SqliteEntitlementRepository is provided for local/dev and small-scale production. For scale or compliance, use a managed database.

## 7. Backup/Export Requirement

- You must regularly back up the entitlement database (e.g., entitlements.db for SQLite).
- Implement export routines for compliance and disaster recovery.

## 8. Revocation Audit Requirement

- All revocations (cancellation, payment failure, Discord role removal) must be logged and auditable.
- Review entitlement and Discord role state regularly for consistency.

## 6. Production Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Set all environment variables in your production environment (Azure, AWS, etc).
- [ ] Use live Stripe keys and price IDs.
- [ ] Use live Discord bot token and client secret.
- [ ] Confirm HTTPS is enabled.
- [ ] Confirm Stripe webhook endpoint is reachable and secret is set.
- [ ] Confirm Discord bot is in your server and has Manage Roles permission.
- [ ] Confirm no secrets are present in appsettings files or source code.


## 9. Revocation Rules

- On payment failure or subscription cancellation, paid Discord roles are removed and entitlement is revoked.
- On downgrade, roles are updated to match new package.
- All revocation actions should be logged for audit.

---

**Never commit real secrets or live price IDs to source control. Always use environment variables for secrets and IDs.**
