## Repository Admission Rule

No new JayPVentures LLC repository may be created unless it meets one of these conditions:

1. It is a production application.
2. It is a reusable infrastructure/service component.
3. It is a legally or operationally isolated records/evidence repository.
4. It is a research/lab environment that cannot safely live inside jayventures-labs.

Default decision: use an existing repository and create a bounded folder/module.

## Required Pre-Create Checklist

Before creating any repo:

- Confirm the work cannot live inside an existing repo.
- Confirm the owner account is JayPVentures-LLC, not a personal profile.
- Define the repo purpose in one sentence.
- Define visibility: PUBLIC, PRIVATE, or INTERNAL.
- Define whether it is production, lab, records, or infrastructure.
- Confirm no duplicate repo already exists.
- Confirm governance files will be added before first push.
