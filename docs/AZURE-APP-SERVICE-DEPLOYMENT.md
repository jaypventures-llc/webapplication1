# Azure App Service Deployment Plan

## Target

Deploy JPVOS as an ASP.NET Core Blazor web app.

## Runtime

- Framework: .NET 8
- Project: src/JPVOS/JPVOS.csproj
- Solution: JPVOS.sln
- Release artifact: jpvos-release
- Hosting target: Azure App Service

## Quick Start

To provision Azure App Service infrastructure, use the provisioning scripts:

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\scripts\provision-azure-appservice.ps1 -Path A -SubscriptionId "YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID"
```

**Linux/macOS (Bash):**
```bash
./scripts/provision-azure-appservice.sh -Path A -SubscriptionId "YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID"
```

See [AZURE-PROVISIONING-GUIDE.md](./AZURE-PROVISIONING-GUIDE.md) for complete instructions.

## Required Azure Setup

The provisioning scripts automate these steps. If provisioning manually:

- [ ] Azure subscription selected
- [ ] Resource group created (e.g., `rg-jpv-os-prod`)
- [ ] App Service Plan created (recommend B1 or higher)
- [ ] Web App created with .NET 8 runtime
- [ ] Runtime stack configured for .NET 8
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] App settings configured:
  - `AllowedHosts` - Your domain(s), e.g., `yourdomain.azurewebsites.net;yourdomain.com`
- [ ] Deployment credentials or publish profile configured
- [ ] GitHub Actions secrets added:
  - `AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME` - Your Web App name
  - `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE` - Publish profile XML content
- [x] Deployment workflow added (`azure-deploy.yml`)
- [x] Health endpoint added (`/health`)
- [ ] Custom domain configured
- [ ] Privacy policy URL configured
- [ ] Terms URL configured
- [ ] Support contact configured

## Deployment Workflows

- **CI Build** (`ci.yml`) - Runs on every PR and push to main
- **Release Package** (`release-package.yml`) - Creates release artifacts
- **Deploy to Azure** (`azure-deploy.yml`) - Manual deployment to Azure App Service
- **Container Build** (`container-build.yml`) - Builds and pushes Docker image to GHCR

## Alternative Deployment

While Azure App Service provisioning is blocked by Conditional Access requirements, container-based deployment is available. See [CONTAINER-DEPLOYMENT.md](./CONTAINER-DEPLOYMENT.md) for instructions on deploying to:

- Render
- Railway
- Fly.io
- DigitalOcean App Platform
- Google Cloud Run
- AWS App Runner

## Release Gate

No production deployment is approved until build, release artifact, HTTPS, environment configuration, logging, privacy, terms, and rollback path are verified.
